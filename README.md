# How-to-handle-the-keyboard-in-iOS

# The Goal
In this project I learnt about keyboard handling programmaticaly. 


# What I created
When the user tap text field the keyboard will pop up, pushing the bottom constraint up taking the height of the keyboard.        
If the user tap outside the textfield on the view, the keyboard will disappear and the bottom constraint will drop down to its initial original position

# What I Learned
Creating @IBOutlets and manipulating with them programmaticaly.          
Getting familiar with the UITapGestureRecognizer.              
Understanding Swift lifecycle principles.
